A site for buying and selling art.

The design is based around the ideas that:
1. Each composition is unique, and the long tail of the internet can be used to find the person who wants to buy that unique composition.
2. People can share a comosition's listing on social media, and these people are part of the sale.

A good place to start understanding the structure of the code is at ```app.js```.
